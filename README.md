# DD2430-Grupp19

This was a group project done for the course Project Course in Data Science (DD2430) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The project focused on the use of artifical neural networks for skeletonizations of black and white pictures, and was built upon the paper: *"U-Net based convolutional neural network for skeleton extraction"* by Panichev et al. 

The code uses PyTorch for the neural network.
